Get weather based on event location from a calendar

<h2>Event-based Weather</h2>
The idea behind this project is to push weather notifications based on events in your Google calendar. This works by pulling events using the Google Calendar API and using Wunderground's API to show the forecast for that event and location.
These will be pushed as a notification using Pushbullet and PushingBox APIs to devices.
