Get weather based on event location from a calendar

<h2>Event-based Weather</h2>
The idea behind this project is to push weather notifications based on events in your Google calendar. This works by pulling events using the Google Calendar's and Wunderground's APIs to show the forecast for the event's listed date, time, and location. These are then pushed as a notification using Pushbullet's API to your devices.

The next part will be to run this automatically by hosting it on a Raspberry Pi and using a bash script to automate the process of running the script.
